# Problem

A **critical point** in a linked list is defined as **either** a **local maxima** or a **local minima**.

A node is a **local maxima** if the current node has a value **strictly greater** than the previous node and the next node.

A node is a **local minima** if the current node has a value **strictly smaller** than the previous node and the next node.

Note that a node can only be a local maxima/minima if there exists **both** a previous node and a next node.

Given a linked list `head`, return _an array of length 2 containing_ `[minDistance, maxDistance]` _where_ `minDistance` _is the **minimum distance** between **any two distinct** critical points and_ `maxDistance` _is the **maximum distance** between **any two distinct** critical points. If there are **fewer** than two critical points, return_ `[-1, -1]`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = [3,1]
**Output:** [-1,-1]
**Explanation:** There are no critical points in [3,1].

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/13/a2.png)

**Input:** head = [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]
**Output:** [1,3]
**Explanation:** There are three critical points:
- [5,3,**1**,2,5,1,2]: The third node is a local minima because 1 is less than 3 and 2.
- [5,3,1,2,**5**,1,2]: The fifth node is a local maxima because 5 is greater than 2 and 1.
- [5,3,1,2,5,**1**,2]: The sixth node is a local minima because 1 is less than 5 and 2.
The minimum distance is between the fifth and the sixth node. minDistance = 6 - 5 = 1.
The maximum distance is between the third and the sixth node. maxDistance = 6 - 3 = 3.

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/14/a5.png)

**Input:** head = [1,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,7]
**Output:** [3,3]
**Explanation:** There are two critical points:
- [1,**3**,2,2,3,2,2,2,7]: The second node is a local maxima because 3 is greater than 1 and 2.
- [1,3,2,2,**3**,2,2,2,7]: The fifth node is a local maxima because 3 is greater than 2 and 2.
Both the minimum and maximum distances are between the second and the fifth node.
Thus, minDistance and maxDistance is 5 - 2 = 3.
Note that the last node is not considered a local maxima because it does not have a next node.

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[2, 105]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 105`

## Solutions

## Single Pass with Extra Space

**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$  |  **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$

The solution involves identifying critical points, saving their indices in a separate array, and traversing through that array to find the minimum distance between consecutive critical points. The maximum distance is always the difference between the first and last indices.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def nodesBetweenCriticalPoints(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> List[int]:

        result = [-1, -1]
        critical_points = []

        i = 1
        prev = cur = head
        while cur.next.next:
            prev = cur
            cur = cur.next
            if prev.val < cur.val > cur.next.val:
                critical_points.append(i)
            if prev.val > cur.val < cur.next.val:
                critical_points.append(i)
            i += 1
        
        if len(critical_points) < 2:
            return result

        result[-1] = critical_points[-1] - critical_points[0]
        result[0] = float('inf')
        for i in range(len(critical_points) - 1):
            result[0] = min(result[0], critical_points[i + 1] - critical_points[i])

        return result

```

## #🏆  2. Single Pass, no Extra Space

**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$  |  **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$

The approach above can be optimized further. To find the maximum distance, let's save the first critical point in the variable `first` and the second critical point in `last`. We can also introduce a variable `minimum` to keep track of the smallest distance between consecutive critical points as we traverse the list.

If we find only 1 critical point, return `[-1, -1]`.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def nodesBetweenCriticalPoints(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> List[int]:

        def criticalPoint(prev, cur, next):
            return (prev.val < cur.val > cur.next.val) or (prev.val > cur.val < cur.next.val)

        minimum = float('inf')
        first = last = -1

        i = 1
        prev = cur = head
        while cur.next.next:
            prev = cur
            cur = cur.next
            if criticalPoint(prev, cur, cur.next):
                if first == -1: first = i
                if last != -1: minimum = min(minimum, i - last)
                last = i
            i += 1
        
        if last - first == 0:
            return [-1, -1]

        return [minimum, last - first]
