# Problem


>[!question]
>Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return _an array of their intersection_. Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays and you may return the result in **any order**.


**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
**Output:** [2,2]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
**Output:** [4,9]
**Explanation:** [9,4] is also accepted.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000`

# Solutions

## 1.  #🏆 Hash Map Approach

**Time Complexity:** $O(n + m)$  |  **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$

To solve the problem, we can use a dictionary to store the frequency of each number in the first array. As we iterate through the second array, we check if each number is present in the dictionary with a frequency greater than 0. If so, we add the number to the `result` list and decrement its frequency in the dictionary. This ensures that each number is only added to the result as many times as it appears in both arrays.

```python
def intersect(nums1, nums2):
    memo = defaultdict(int)
    for num in nums1:
        memo[num] += 1
    
    result = []
    for num in nums2:
        if memo[num] > 0:
            result.append(num)
            memo[num] -= 1
    
    return result
```


## 2.  #🍔  Overlap of Hash Maps

**Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n + m \log m)$  |  **Space Complexity:** $O(n + m)$ 

We can also use two dictionaries and find the overlap between them. In Python, you can make a #oneliner out of it.

```python
def intersect(nums1, nums2):
	return list((Counter(nums1) & Counter(nums2)).elements())
```

## 3.  Sorting & Two-Pointers

**Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n + m \log m)$  |  **Space Complexity:** $O(min(m,n))$

Alternatively, we can sort both arrays and use a two-pointer approach. In this method, `p1` points to an element in `nums1`, and `p2` points to an element in `nums2`. While iterating through the sorted arrays, if the element at `p1` is greater than the element at `p2`, increment `p2`. If the element at `p1` is smaller, increment `p1`. If the elements are equal, add the element to the result list and increment both pointers. This way, you can efficiently find the common elements in both arrays.

```python
def intersect_sorted(nums1, nums2):
    nums1.sort()
    nums2.sort()

    p1 = p2 = 0
    result = []

    while p1 < len(nums1) and p2 < len(nums2):
        if nums1[p1] == nums2[p2]:
            result.append(nums1[p1])
            p1 += 1
            p2 += 1
        elif nums1[p1] > nums2[p2]:
            p2 += 1
        else:
            p1 += 1
            
    return result
```
