# Problem

>[!question]
>Given an integer array `arr`, return `true` if there are three consecutive odd numbers in the array. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr = [2,6,4,1]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** There are no three consecutive odds.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** arr = [1,2,34,3,4,5,7,23,12]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** [5,7,23] are three consecutive odds.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= arr.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= arr[i] <= 1000`

# Solutions

## 1. Brute force

**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$  |  **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$

To solve the problem, we can check every possible trio of consecutive numbers. If all three numbers in a trio are odd, we return `True`. To check if a number is odd, we simply check if the remainder when the number is divided by 2 is 1.

```python
class Solution:
    def threeConsecutiveOdds(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:

        for i in range(len(arr) - 2):
            if arr[i] % 2 == 1 and arr[i+1] % 2 == 1 and arr[i+2] % 2 == 1:
                return True
            
        return False

```

Alternatively, we can check if the product of three consecutive numbers is odd.

```python
class Solution:
    def threeConsecutiveOdds(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:

        for i in range(len(arr) - 2):
            if (arr[i] * arr[i+1] * arr[i+2]) % 2 == 1:
                return True
            
        return False

```

## #🏆 2. Counting

**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$  |  **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$

A more optimized solution involves counting the odd numbers as we iterate through the given array. We increment the counter each time we encounter an odd number. If the counter reaches 3, we return `True`. If a number is not odd, we reset the counter to 0.

```python
class Solution:
    def threeConsecutiveOdds(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:

        count = 0        
        for num in arr:
            if num % 2 == 1:
                count += 1
                if count == 3: 
                    return True
            else:
                count = 0
                
        return False
```
