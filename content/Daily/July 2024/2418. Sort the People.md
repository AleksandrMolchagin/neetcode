## Problem

> [!question]
> You are given an array of strings `names`, and an array `heights` that consists of **distinct** positive integers. Both arrays are of length `n`.

For each index `i`, `names[i]` and `heights[i]` denote the name and height of the `ith` person.

Return `names` _sorted in **descending** order by the people's heights_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** names = ["Mary","John","Emma"], heights = [180,165,170]
**Output:** ["Mary","Emma","John"]
**Explanation:** Mary is the tallest, followed by Emma and John.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** names = ["Alice","Bob","Bob"], heights = [155,185,150]
**Output:** ["Bob","Alice","Bob"]
**Explanation:** The first Bob is the tallest, followed by Alice and the second Bob.

**Constraints:**

- `n == names.length == heights.length`
- `1 <= n <= 103`
- `1 <= names[i].length <= 20`
- `1 <= heights[i] <= 105`
- `names[i]` consists of lower and upper case English letters.
- All the values of `heights` are distinct.

## Solutions

## 1. Zip & Sort

**Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$  |  **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$

The easiest approach in python written in a minute.

```python
class Solution:
    def sortPeople(self, names: List[str], heights: List[int]) -> List[str]:
        
        people = list(zip(heights, names))
        
        people.sort(reverse=True)

        result = []

        for person in people:
            result.append(person[1])

        return result
```

##  2. #🍔 Zip & Sort One-liner

**Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$  |  **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$

The same approach, but in one liner. Note: `.sort` function returns `None`. Therefore, we need to use function `sorted`.

```python
def get_sorted_names(heights, names):
    return [person[1] for person in sorted(zip(heights, names), reverse=True)]
```

## 3. Bubble Sort

**Time Complexity:** $O(n ^ 2)$  |  **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$

The idea behind Bubble Sort is simple: compare two adjacent elements and swap them if needed. Note: the inner loop can end at `len(heights) - i - 1` since the largest unsorted element will always 'bubble up' to the end."

```python
class Solution:
    def sortPeople(self, names: List[str], heights: List[int]) -> List[str]:

        for i in range(0, len(heights)):
            for j in range(0, len(heights) - i - 1):
                if heights[j] < heights[j + 1]:
                    heights[j + 1], heights[j] = heights[j], heights[j + 1]
                    names[j + 1], names[j] = names[j], names[j + 1]
            
        return names

```
