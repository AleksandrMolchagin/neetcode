## Problem

> [!question]
> You are given an array of strings `names`, and an array `heights` that consists of **distinct** positive integers. Both arrays are of length `n`.

For each index `i`, `names[i]` and `heights[i]` denote the name and height of the `ith` person.

Return `names` _sorted in **descending** order by the people's heights_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** names = ["Mary","John","Emma"], heights = [180,165,170]
**Output:** ["Mary","Emma","John"]
**Explanation:** Mary is the tallest, followed by Emma and John.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** names = ["Alice","Bob","Bob"], heights = [155,185,150]
**Output:** ["Bob","Alice","Bob"]
**Explanation:** The first Bob is the tallest, followed by Alice and the second Bob.

**Constraints:**

- `n == names.length == heights.length`
- `1 <= n <= 103`
- `1 <= names[i].length <= 20`
- `1 <= heights[i] <= 105`
- `names[i]` consists of lower and upper case English letters.
- All the values of `heights` are distinct.

## Solutions

## 1. Zip & Sort

**Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$  |  **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$

The easiest approach in python written in a minute.

```python
class Solution:
    def sortPeople(self, names: List[str], heights: List[int]) -> List[str]:
        
        people = list(zip(heights, names))
        
        people.sort(reverse=True)

        result = []

        for person in people:
            result.append(person[1])

        return result
```

##  2. #🍔 Zip & Sort One-liner

**Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$  |  **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$

The same approach, but in one liner. Note: `.sort` function returns `None`. Therefore, we need to use function `sorted`.

```python
def get_sorted_names(heights, names):
    return [person[1] for person in sorted(zip(heights, names), reverse=True)]
```

## 3. Bubble Sort

**Time Complexity:** $O(n ^ 2)$  |  **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$

The idea behind Bubble Sort is simple: compare two adjacent elements and swap them if needed. Note: the inner loop can end at `len(heights) - i - 1` since the largest unsorted element will always 'bubble up' to the end."

```python
class Solution:
    def sortPeople(self, names: List[str], heights: List[int]) -> List[str]:

        for i in range(0, len(heights)):
            for j in range(0, len(heights) - i - 1):
                if heights[j] < heights[j + 1]:
                    heights[j + 1], heights[j] = heights[j], heights[j + 1]
                    names[j + 1], names[j] = names[j], names[j + 1]
            
        return names

```

## 4. Selection Sort

**Time Complexity:** $O(n ^ 2)$  |  **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$

Another simple sorting algorithm is Selection Sort. We find the maximum element, place it at the start, and then continue from the next position.

**Interesting fact**: While the time and space complexities are the same, selection sort can be a better algorithm than bubble sort if the cost of writing to memory matters. In this algorithm, we make O(n)O(n) swaps, not O(n2)O(n2).

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def sortPeople(self, names: List[str], heights: List[int]) -> List[str]:
        
        for i in range(0, len(heights) - 1):
            max_index = i
            for j in range(i + 1, len(heights)):
                if heights[max_index] < heights[j]:
                    max_index = j
            heights[i], heights[max_index] = heights[max_index], heights[i]
            names[i], names[max_index] = names[max_index], names[i]           

        return names
```

## 5. Insertion Sort

**Time Complexity:** $O(n ^ 2)$  |  **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$

The name speaks for itself. We simulate the insertion of the items into their correct place. First, we assume that the first item is in the right spot. We pick the next value and iterate backward until we find its place, swapping the values as we go.

```python
class Solution:
    def sortPeople(self, names: List[str], heights: List[int]) -> List[str]:
        
        for i in range(1, len(heights)):
            key = heights[i]
            key_name = names[i]
            j = i - 1

            while j >= 0 and key > heights[j]:
                heights[j + 1] = heights[j]
                names[j + 1] = names[j]
                j -= 1
            
            heights[j + 1] = key
            names[j + 1] = key_name

        return names

```
