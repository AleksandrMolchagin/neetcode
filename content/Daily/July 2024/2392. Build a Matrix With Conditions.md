## Problem

>![question]
 > You are given a **positive** integer `k`. You are also given: 1) a 2D integer array `rowConditions` of size `n` where `rowConditions[i] = [abovei, belowi]`, and 2) a 2D integer array `colConditions` of size `m` where `colConditions[i] = [lefti, righti]`.

The two arrays contain integers from `1` to `k`.

You have to build a `k x k` matrix that contains each of the numbers from `1` to `k` **exactly once**. The remaining cells should have the value `0`.

The matrix should also satisfy the following conditions:

- The number `abovei` should appear in a **row** that is strictly **above** the row at which the number `belowi` appears for all `i` from `0` to `n - 1`.
- The number `lefti` should appear in a **column** that is strictly **left** of the column at which the number `righti` appears for all `i` from `0` to `m - 1`.

Return _**any** matrix that satisfies the conditions_. If no answer exists, return an empty matrix.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/07/06/gridosdrawio.png)

**Input:** k = 3, rowConditions = $[ [1,2],[3,2] ]$, colConditions =$[ [2,1],[3,2] ]$
**Output:**$[ [3,0,0],[0,0,1],[0,2,0] ]$
**Explanation:** The diagram above shows a valid example of a matrix that satisfies all the conditions.
The row conditions are the following:
- Number 1 is in row 1, and number 2 is in row 2, so 1 is above 2 in the matrix.
- Number 3 is in row 0, and number 2 is in row 2, so 3 is above 2 in the matrix.
The column conditions are the following:
- Number 2 is in column 1, and number 1 is in column 2, so 2 is left of 1 in the matrix.
- Number 3 is in column 0, and number 2 is in column 1, so 3 is left of 2 in the matrix.
Note that there may be multiple correct answers.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** k = 3, rowConditions = $[ [1,2],[2,3],[3,1],[2,3] ]$, colConditions = $[ [2,1] ]$
**Output:** $[ ]$
**Explanation:** From the first two conditions, 3 has to be below 1 but the third conditions needs 3 to be above 1 to be satisfied.
No matrix can satisfy all the conditions, so we return the empty matrix.

## Solutions

## #🏆 Topological Sorting

**Time Complexity:** $O(k^2)$  |  **Space Complexity:** $O(k^2)$

To solve the problem, we need to utilize a technique called [topological sorting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL-KzMXSXXI).

Topological sorting is an excellent method for handling priorities and dependencies. Imagine you are organizing a set of tasks where some tasks must be completed before others. For example, you can't bake a cake until you've mixed the ingredients. If we represent each task as a number and each dependency (must-do-before) as a directed arrow from one task to another, we can use topological sorting to find an order to complete the tasks without violating any dependencies.

In simple terms, we build a graph that represents dependencies.

The problem can be divided into two subproblems:

1. What is the vertical sequence of all numbers?
2. What is the horizontal sequence of all numbers?

Once we solve these problems, constructing the matrix becomes straightforward.

Let's consider only the horizontal sequences. In the first example, we know that:

- 2 should be before 1 `(2 -> 1)`
- 3 should be before 2 `(3 -> 2)`

Combining these conditions, we get:

- `3 -> 2 -> 1`

How do we know if it is impossible to build the matrix with the given conditions? It's very simple - if there is a loop in the graph. For example, if we add the condition:

- 1 should be before 3

Then we have:

- `3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3`

This forms a loop, making it impossible to build the matrix as per the given conditions.

```python

    def buildMatrix(self, k: int, rowConditions: List[List[int]], colConditions: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:

            if src in visited:
                return True

            visited.add(src)
            path.add(src)

            for dst in graph[src]:
                if not dfs(graph, dst, visited, path, order):
                    return False
            
            order.append(src)
            path.remove(src)
            return True

            graph = defaultdict(list)
            for edge in edges:

            visited, path = set(), set()
            order = []
            for src in range(1, k + 1):
                if src not in visited:
                    if not dfs(graph, src, visited, path, order):
                        return []

            return order[::-1]
