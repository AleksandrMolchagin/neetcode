# Problem

>[!question] Given an array of integers `nums`, return _the length_ of the longest consecutive sequence of elements. A _consecutive sequence_ is a sequence of elements in which each element is exactly `1` greater than the previous element. You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: nums = [2,20,4,10,3,4,5]

Output: 4
```

Copy

Explanation: The longest consecutive sequence is `[2, 3, 4, 5]`.

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: nums = [0,3,2,5,4,6,1,1]

Output: 7
```

Copy

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

# Solutions

## 1. Sorting 

**Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n )$  |  **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$

The solution involves sorting the array and iterating through its elements, counting the maximum streak of consecutive elements. To handle duplicates, we use `continue` if the current element is the same as the previous one.

```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

        if len(nums) == 0:
            return 0

        nums.sort()

        max_counter = 1
        counter = 1

        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            cur, prev = nums[i], nums[i-1]
            if cur == prev: continue
            if prev + 1 == cur:
                counter += 1
            else:
                counter = 1
            max_counter = max(counter, max_counter)

        return max(max_counter, counter)

```

## #🏆  2. Hashing 

**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$  |  **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$

To solve the problem with the required time complexity of $O(n)$, we can utilize a set. Once we build the set based on the given array, we iterate through its elements. If the element immediately preceding the current element (`element - 1`) is in the set, we skip the iteration to avoid double-counting (otherwise, it would not be $O(n)$. Then, while the next potential element (`element + 1`) is in the set, we increment the counter.

```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

        if len(nums) == 0:
            return 0

        memo = set(nums)

        max_counter = 0
        for element in memo:
            if element - 1 in memo: continue
            counter = 1
            while element + 1 in memo:
                element += 1
                counter += 1
            max_counter = max(max_counter, counter)    

        return max(max_counter, counter)

```
