# Introduction 

Hello there! 👋 My name is Aleksandr and I built this website to collect solutions to [Neetcode 150](https://neetcode.io/practice) problems! My goal is to outline solutions to all problems. By doing this I am improving my ability to explain algorithmic solutions and creating a valuable resource for others preparing for coding interviews or enhancing their problem-solving skills.

There are a few rules I set to myself:
- All problems should have `multiple solutions` (when possible)
- Each solution should include `time complexity` and `space complexity`
- All solutions should be explained `concisely`
- And...

```python
print("All problems should we solved in `Python` 🦑✨")
```

**Progress: 2 / 150**
