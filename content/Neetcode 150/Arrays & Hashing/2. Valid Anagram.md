# Problem

> [!question] 
>
Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if the two strings are anagrams of each other, otherwise return `false`. An **anagram** is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string, but the order of the characters can be different.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: s = "racecar", t = "carrace"

Output: true
```

Copy

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: s = "jar", t = "jam"

Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

# Solutions

## 1.  #🏆  Build dictionaries

**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$  |  **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$

Count the occurrences of each character in both strings and compare the dictionaries. If they match, the strings are anagrams. The space complexity is $O(1)$ as it depends on the number of unique characters, not the length of the strings.


```python
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        dict1 = defaultdict(int)
        dict2 = defaultdict(int)

        for ch in s:
            dict1[ch] += 1

        for ch in t:    
            dict2[ch] += 1

        return dict1 == dict2
```

This solution can be optimized further. We can populate only one dictionary with character counts from string `s`, and then decrement these counts using characters from the string `t`. If any value in the dictionary is not equal to `0` after this process, the strings are not anagrams.

```python
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if len(s) != len(t):
            return False
        
        memo = defaultdict(int)

        for char in s:
            memo[char] += 1
        
        for char in t:
            memo[char] -= 1
        
        for count in memo.values():
            if count != 0:
                return False
            
        return True
```

Python-based #oneliner. Technically, a `Counter` functions as a specialized dictionary designed for counting hashable objects. Therefore, this approach is similar to using a dictionary but is more concise and may differ slightly in performance.

```python
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        return Counter(s) == Counter(t)
```

## 2.  Count characters with a fixed-size array

**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$  |  **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$

Assuming that every string contains only lowercase letters, we can use an array of size 26 to store character counters instead of dictionaries. The trick is use `ord()` to get the Unicode code point of a given character and to use it to determine the index in the array.

```python
# Get the Unicode code point of a character 
print(ord('a'))  # Output: 97 
print(ord('z'))  # Output: 122
```

```python
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if len(s) != len(t):
            return False
        
        order = [0] * 26 
        
        for char in s:
            order[ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1
        
        for char in t:
            order[ord(char) - ord('a')] -= 1
        
        for value in order:
            if value != 0:
                return False
        
        return True

```

## 3.  #🍔  Sort strings

**Time Complexity:** $O(n \log n)$  |  **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$

Another python-based #oneliner. The idea is to sort both strings and compare the results. When we use the `sorted()` method on a string in Python, it returns a list of sorted characters. Therefore, we need to join the sorted lists back into strings before comparing them. Or do we..?

```python
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        return ''.join(sorted(s)) == ''.join(sorted(t))
```

No, we don't.

```python
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        return sorted(s) == sorted(t)
```
