# Problem

>[!question]
>Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `output` where `output[i]` is the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

Each product is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.

Follow-up: Could you solve it in 𝑂(𝑛)O(n) time without using the division operation?

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: nums = [1,2,4,6]

Output: [48,24,12,8]
```

Copy

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,3]

Output: [0,-6,0,0,0]
```

Copy

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `-20 <= nums[i] <= 20`

# Solutions

## #🏆  Left and right products

**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$  |  **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$

To solve this problem, we can create arrays that store *the product of all elements to the left* and *the product all elements to the right* of each given number. Then, we use a for-loop to multiply these stored values together. This approach will give us the product of the array excluding the current element.

```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        
        l_product = [1 for num in nums]
        r_product  = [1 for num in nums]

        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            l_product[i] = l_product[i-1] * nums[i-1]

        for i in range(len(nums) - 2, -1, -1):
            r_product[i] = r_product[i+1] * nums[i+1]

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            nums[i] = l_product[i] * r_product[i]

        return nums

```

However, we can optimize this further by using a single output array to:
1. Store the left products directly
2. Updating it with the right products in a single pass

To achieve this solution, we can simplify the original code without needing an in-depth understanding of how it works. We use variable `R` to store what used to be `r_product[i+1] * nums[i+1]`.

```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        
        n = len(nums)
        result = [1] * n

		# Store left products
        for i in range(1, n):
            result[i] = result[i - 1] * nums[i - 1]

		#Updating the array with the right products in a single pass
        R = 1
        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            R = R * nums[i + 1]
            result[i] = result[i] * R

        return result
```

## 2. Ignore the rules & use division

**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$  |  **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$

If we decide to ignore the condition not to use the division operator, the space complexity truly becomes $O(1)$. The solution is simple: we get the total product and iterate through the array, updating all numbers to `product // num`. However, it is important to remember that we might encounter zeros. If there are more than 1 zero, all numbers in the final array will be 0. If there is exactly 1 zero, all elements in the final array will be 0 except for the position corresponding to the zero element - it will be set to the total product of all non-zero numbers.

```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        total_product = 1
        zero_count = 0
        
        for num in nums:
            if num != 0:
                total_product *= num
            else:
                zero_count += 1
        
        result = [0] * len(nums)
        
        if zero_count > 1:
            return result
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] == 0:
                result[i] = total_product
            elif zero_count == 1:
                result[i] = 0
            else:
                result[i] = total_product // nums[i]
                
        return result

```
