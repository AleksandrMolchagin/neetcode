## Problem

Given a string `s`, return `true` if it is a **palindrome**, otherwise return `false`.

A **palindrome** is a string that reads the same forward and backward. It is also case-insensitive and ignores all non-alphanumeric characters.

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: s = "Was it a car or a cat I saw?"

Output: true
```

Copy

Explanation: After considering only alphanumerical characters we have "wasitacaroracatisaw", which is a palindrome.

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: s = "tab a cat"

Output: false
```

Copy

Explanation: "tabacat" is not a palindrome.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s` is made up of only printable ASCII characters.

## Solution
## 1. Two Pointers

**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$  |  **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$

To solve this problem, we use a two-pointer approach. We compare characters from the left and right ends of the string, converting them to lowercase for consistency. If either character is not alphanumeric (i.e., not a letter or a number), we skip it. This process continues until the pointers meet or cross each other.

```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        
        l, r = 0, len(s) - 1
        while l < r:
            if not s[l].isalnum():
                l += 1
                continue
            elif not s[r].isalnum():
                r -= 1
                continue
            elif s[l].lower() != s[r].lower():
                return False
            l += 1
            r -= 1

        return True

```

## 2. Reverse The String

**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$  |  **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$

This version of the solution simplifies the problem by first filtering out non-alphanumeric characters and converting the remaining characters to lowercase. It then checks if the processed string is equal to its reverse.

```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:

        s = ''.join(ch.lower() if ch.isalnum() else '' for ch in s)

        return s == s[::-1]

```

Alternatively, we can utilize `re` module in Python for regular expressions:

```python
import re

class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:

        cleaned_s = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9]', '', s).lower()
    
        return cleaned_s == cleaned_s[::-1]
```
